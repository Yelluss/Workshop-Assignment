# Workshop-Assignment

The 3 challenges i've implemented are:
- A sprinting mechanic that increases the players speed from 1. Player Character w/ The Input System
- A method that plays a random sound, from 2. Background Sound and SFX
- A particle effect challenge, nr. 3, a rain particle effect from 7.Particles
  
I have made the challenges:
- Sprinting when holding down left shift
-Particle system rain
-Method (coroutine) that plays a random thunder sound every 5 to 10 seconds
